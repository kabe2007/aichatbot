# 🎉 Welcome to unSAGED

unSAGED is a cutting-edge chat kit engineered for seamless interaction with AI models. It allows you to easily have conversations with different AI models from a variety of providers, all in one place. It also allows you to manage multiple users and conversations, and synchronize them across different devices.

## 🚀 Upgrading unSAGED

* On November 13th, 2023, we released a major update to unSAGED, which introduced more settings to the conversation. It requires that you update some database table columns. If you are upgrading from a version of unSAGED released before this date, you will need to run the [Upgrade Script](./apps/unsaged/db/UpgradeScript.sql) in the [Supabase SQL editor](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/sql).
* On November 16th, 2023, we released a major update to unSAGED, which converts this repo into monorepo to support the documentation website. It requires that you change a setting in your Vercel project, if you have one. If you do have one, you need to set `apps/unsaged` as the [Root Directory](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#root-directory) in your Vercel project's settings.
