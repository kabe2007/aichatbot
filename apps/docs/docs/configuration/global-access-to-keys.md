# Global Access to API keys

By default, unSAGED will require users to provide their own API keys for each API they want to use.
You can configure unSAGED to use predefined API keys for all users by setting the appropriate environment variables. This is helpful if you want to provide access to employees or students without requiring them to sign up for their own API keys.
